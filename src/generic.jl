### Adjoint Fields

# Fields implicitly have pixel indices which run from 1:Npix and "spin" indices
# which run e.g. from 1:3 labelling (I,Q,U) in the case of an S02 Field.
# Additionally, we may have vectors of fields like ∇*f which have an additional
# index labeling the component. By choice, we chose to make the Julia `'` symbol
# only take the adjoint of the spin and vector components, but not of the pixel.
# This means that f' * f will return a spin-0 field. To fully transpose and
# contract all indices, one would use the `⋅` function, f⋅f, which yields a
# scalar, as expected.

# Much like the Julia Base library, doing an adjoint like `f'` just creates a
# wrapper around the field to keep track of things. Adjoint fields have very
# limited functionality implemented as compared to normal fields, so its best to
# work with normal fields and only take the adjoint at the end if you need it.
struct AdjField{B,S,P,F<:Field{B,S,P}} <: Field{B,S,P}

    # need this seeingly redundant constructor to avoid ambiguity with 
    # F(f) = convert(F,f) definition in algebra.jl:

### LinOp

#
# A LinOp{B,S,P} represents a linear operator which acts on a field with a
# particular pixelization scheme P and spin S. The meaning of basis B is not
# that the operator is stored in this basis, but rather that fields should be
# converted to this basis before the operator is applied (this makes writing the
# implementing functions somewhat more convenient)
# 
# In the simplest case, LinOps should implement mul!, ldiv!, and adjoint. 
# 
#     * mul!(result, ::LinOp, ::Field) - apply the operator, storing the answer in `result`
#     * ldiv!(result, ::LinOp, ::Field) - apply the inverse operator, storing the answer in `result`
#     * adjoint(::LinOp) - return the adjoint operator
# 
# By default `*` and `\` use `mul!` and `ldiv!`, assuming the result will be
# `simlar` to the field being acted on. If the operator returns a different kind
# of field, this can be specified by overloading `allocate_result(::LinOp,
# ::Field)` (see below)
#
# Other functions which can be implemented:
#
#     * sqrt(L::LinOp) - the sqrt of the operator s.t. sqrt(L)*sqrt(L) = L
# 
#
# By default, LinOps receive the following functionality:
# 
#     * Automatic basis conversion: L * f first converts f to L's basis, then
#     applies *, so that LinOps only need to implement *(::LinOp, ::F) where F
#     is a type already in the correct basis. 
# 
#     * Lazy evaluation: C = A + B returns a LazyBinaryOp object which when
#     applied to a field, C*f, computes A*f + B*f.
# 
#     * Vector conversion: Af = A[~f] returns an object which when acting on an
#     AbstractVector, Af * v, converts v to a Field, then applies A.
# 
abstract type LinOp{B<:Basis, S<:Spin, P<:Pix} end

# allocate the result of applying a LinOp to a given field. 
# the default below assumes the result is the same type as the Field itself, but
# this can be specialized (e.g. ∇*f returns instead a vector of fields)
allocate_result(::LinOp, f::Field) = similar(f)

# `*` and `\` use `mul!` and `ldiv!` which we require each LinOp implement
# here we also do the automatic basis conversion to the LinOps specified basis
*(L::LinOp{B}, f::Field) where {B} = (f′=B(f);  mul!(allocate_result(L,f′),L,f′))
\(L::LinOp{B}, f::Field) where {B} = (f′=B(f); ldiv!(allocate_result(L,f′),L,f′))

# Left multiplication uses `adjoint` which we require each LinOp implement
*(f::AdjField, L::LinOp) = (L'*f')'


### LinDiagOp

#
# LinDiagOp{B,S,P} is an operator which is diagonal in basis B. This is
# important because it means we can do fast broadcasting between these
# operators and other fields which are also in basis B.
# 
# Each LinDiagOp needs to implement broadcast_data(::Type{F}, L::LinDiagOp) which
# should return a tuple of data which can be broadcast together with the data of a
# field of type F.
#
abstract type LinDiagOp{B,S,P} <: LinOp{B,S,P} end

Diagonal(L::LinDiagOp) = L

# scalars which are allowed in our expressions must be real because we
# implicitly assume our maps are real, and addition/multiplication by a complex
# number, even of the fourier transform, would break this.

const FieldArray{F<:Union{Field,LinOp}} = Union{FieldVector{F}, FieldRowVector{F}, FieldMatrix{F}}


### Matrix conversion

# We can build explicit matrix representations of linear operators by applying
# them to a set of basis vectors which form a complete basis (in practice this
# is prohibitive except for fairly small maps, e.g. 16x16 pixels, but is quite
# useful)
